create a lightweight server in golang that does the following.
- listens to /leetcodestat endpoint and retrieves the leetcode username string from the request payload over REST api.
- uses this leetcode username and makes a graphql call to leetcode graphql endpoint ```https://leetcode.com/graphql``` with the query ```			query userPublicProfile($username: String!) {
				matchedUser(username: $username) {
					contestBadge {
						name
						expired
						hoverText
						icon
					}
					username
					githubUrl
					twitterUrl
					linkedinUrl
					profile {
						ranking
						userAvatar
						realName
						aboutMe
						school
						websites
						countryName
						company
						jobTitle
						skillTags
						postViewCount
						postViewCountDiff
						reputation
						reputationDiff
						solutionCount
						solutionCountDiff
						categoryDiscussCount
						categoryDiscussCountDiff
					}
				}
			}```
- gets the response from leetcode grapqhl and serves it back as a json response in /leetcodestat endpoint
